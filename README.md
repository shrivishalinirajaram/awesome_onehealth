## Scientists



## Areas of work

- **Zoonotic Diseases**: Research focuses on understanding the transmission and prevention of diseases that can spread between animals and humans, such as COVID-19, influenza, rabies, and Ebola.
- **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**: This area investigates the emergence and spread of drug-resistant bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, and how they impact both human and animal health.
- **Microbiome**: This focuses on how environmental, animal and human microbiomes interact to the cause of health and disease.
- **Food Safety**: One Health research in this area examines the links between animal health, food production, and human health, including foodborne illnesses, food security, and the impact of agricultural practices on food safety.
- **Climate Change and Environmental Health**: Researchers study how changes in climate, such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and habitat loss, affect the spread of infectious diseases, food security, and overall human and animal well-being.
- **Ecosystem Health and Biodiversity**: One Health research explores the connections between healthy ecosystems and human and animal health, including the impacts of deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity on disease transmission and overall health.
- **Surveillance and Monitoring**: This area focuses on developing integrated surveillance systems that track diseases and health trends across human, animal, and environmental sectors to enable early detection and response.
- **Risk Assessment and Management**: One Health research includes developing methods for assessing and managing risks related to daily chemical and environmental exposures, zoonotic diseases, AMR, food safety, and other health threats.
- **Policy and Governance**: This area examines the policies and governance structures needed to support One Health approaches and promote intersectoral collaboration.
